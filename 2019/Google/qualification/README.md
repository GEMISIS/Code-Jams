# Google Code Jam - Qualification Round
These are my solutions for the first 3 problems of the Google Code Jam. I passed the qualification round as a result. For problem 1 I did not spend time considering the largest input, though it would have been possible using strings rather easily. For problem 3 I did not spend time optimizing the algorithm and thus ran out of time for the second part of it.
